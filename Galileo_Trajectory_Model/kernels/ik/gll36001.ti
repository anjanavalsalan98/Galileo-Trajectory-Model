SSI I-kernel
===========================================================================
 
     This file contains solid state imaging (SSI) subsystem instrument data
     for Earth I.
 
     The purpose of the SSI data contained in this file is to describe the
     geometric relationship between the SSI coordinate system (``line and
     sample'' coordinates) and the coordinate system of the GLL spacecraft
     structure on which the SSI instrument is mounted (scan platform x-y-z
     coordinates).
 
     In addition to this coordinate conversion information, a ``distortion
     model'' is supplied. This model is required in order to associate
     features in an image with their actual geometric direction vectors.
     Although this type of information is not required for Earth I, it is
     typical of the sort of information that is appropriate for the
     I-kernel.
 
     The data contained in this file, as well as the description of the SSI
     coordinate system, are from reference [1].

Implementation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make
     use of the I-kernel must `load' the kernel, normally during program
     initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their
     names in a data structure called the `kernel pool'. The SPICELIB
     routine LDPOOL loads a kernel file into the pool as shown below.
 
                  CALL LDPOOL ( 'GLL360001.TI' )
 
     In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool,
     the SPICELIB routine RTPOOL is used. See [4] for more details.
 
 
Naming Conventions
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     All names referencing values in this I kernel start with the
     characters `INS' followed by the NAIF SSI instrument number ('-77'
     followed by the instrument subsystem reference number). This naming
     scheme is standard for all I-kernel files and was instituted to
     distinguish I-kernel data from other types of data that may also be
     loaded in the kernel pool.
 
     The remainder of the name is an underscore character, followed by the
     unique name of the data item. For example, the twist offset for the
     SSI camera is specified by
 
                INS-77036_TWIST_OFFSET
 
     The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
     characters.
 
     If the same item is included in more then one file, or if the same
     item appears more than once within a single file, the latest value
     supersedes any earlier values.
 
 
Definition of the SSI Coordinate System
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     The following discussion is from [1].
 
 
        The SSI boresight is by definition parallel to the scan
        platform +L vector.  The remaining angle needed to specify the SSI
        CCD raster orientation with respect to the scan platform coordinate
        system is usually denoted ``twist.'' The AACS group defines twist
        by a positive rotation about the +L vector.  The twist angle is
        then defined as the angle from the platform +M vector to the SSI
        image line, where the positive image line direction is toward
        increasing sample number.  The sketch below shows the scan platform
        coordinate system translated to the center of an SSI image.  The +L
        vector is into the paper [or screen]. SSI image coordinates are
        defined in terms of line and sample coordinates with the origin
        (line 1, sample 1) in the upper left corner of an image, line
        number increasing downward, and sample number increasing on the
        right. The +L vector is placed at coordinate (400,400).  Positive
        twist then indicates a clockwise rotation of the SSI CCD raster
        with respect to the scan platform coordinates.  The platform +M
        vector lies nearly in the direction of increasing image sample
        number and fixed line number while the +N vector completes the
        platform right-handed coordinate system and lies nearly in the
        direction of increasing image line number and fixed sample number.
        [The actual twist angle is much smaller than that indicated in the
        sketch, in which the magnitude of the angle is exaggerated for
        clarity.] The current best estimate of SSI twist defined in this
        way is -0.002797905 rad based on a SCALPS run using data from the
        December, 1989, minical sequence.

Definition of the SSI Distortion Model
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     We quote from [2]:
 
 
        The theoretical distortion can be modeled to an accuracy of
        about 0.01 pixel using the following equation:
 
                         3
               R - r = Ar
 
        where
 
               R   =   actual image distance from the center of the field
                       in pixels
 
               r   =   ideal image distance from the center of the field in
                       pixels
 
                               -9
               A   =  6.58 x 10    for the theoretical distortion
 
 
               1 pixel =  0.0006 in
                       = 15.24   um  in the horizontal or vertical directio
                                     in the focal plane

        This is an estimate taken from reference [7]. The estimate is based

        The original estimate, from reference [6], was 1500 mm.

        Version

              I-kernel.  A structural change to an instrument kernel would
              be adding or deleting data items or changing the number of
              values associated with an existing data item.  A structural
              change would also be assigning different units to values or
              changing the name of a data item.
 
          --  X is incremented by 1 only if pre-existing values are
              changed.
