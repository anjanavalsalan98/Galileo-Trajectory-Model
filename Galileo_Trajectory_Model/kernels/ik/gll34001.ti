UVS I-KERNEL
===========================================================================
 
     This I-kernel contains UVS instrument data for Earth 1. The purpose of
     the UVS data contained in this file is to describe the geometric
     relationship between the UVS Field-of-View (FOV) (slit width and
     length coordinates) and the coordinate system of the GLL spacecraft
     structure on which the UVS instrument is mounted (scan platform x-y-z
     coordinates).

Implementation notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make
     use of the I-kernel must `load' the kernel, normally during program
     initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their
     names in a data structure called the `kernel pool'. The SPICELIB
     routine LDPOOL loads a kernel file into the pool as shown below.
 
                  CALL LDPOOL ( 'GLL34001.TI' )
 
     In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool,
     the SPICELIB routine RTPOOL is used. See [4] for more details.
 
 
Naming Conventions
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     All names referencing values in this I kernel start with the
     characters `INS' followed by the NAIF UVS instrument number ('-77'
     followed by the instrument subsystem reference number). This naming
     scheme is standard for all I-kernel files and was instituted to
     distinguish I-kernel data from other types of data that may also be
     loaded in the kernel pool.
 
     The remainder of the name is an underscore character, followed by the
     unique name of the data item. For example, the UVS FOV width for the
     F-channel detector is specified by
 
         INS-77034_FOV_WIDTH_F
 
     The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
     characters.
 
     If the same item is included in more then one file, or if the same
     item appears more than once within a single file, the latest value
     supersedes any earlier values.
 
 
Definition of the UVS coordinate system
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     The following discussion is from [2].
 
 
        The mounting feet of the UVS have been carefully machined in
        order to insure its optical alignment relative to the SSI.
        Alignment was determined by placing the UVS on the optic axis
        of a laboratory collimator and autocollimating each mounting
        surface with a test flat. ...In addition to the boresight test
        a plane miror has also been aligned to the UVS optic axis and
        can be periodically installed on the instrument to check its
        alignment to other scan platform instruments.
 
        The mounting orientation relative to the Galileo SSI is shown
        below.

        The version number is always positive and given in the form V.X.
        V and X are incremented by following these rules:

              I-kernel.  A structural change to an instrument kernel would
              be adding or deleting data items or changing the number of
              values associated with an existing data item.  A structural
              change would also be assigning different units to values or
              changing the name of a data item.
