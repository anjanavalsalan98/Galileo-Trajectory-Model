HIC I-KERNEL
===========================================================================
 
     This I-kernel contains instrument pointing information for the Heavy
     Ion Counter (HIC) instrument on board the Galileo spacecraft. The HIC
     instrument consists of two basic detector telescopes labled Low Energy
     Telescope E (LET E) and Low Energy Telescope B (LET B). An array of
     solid-state detectors are contained in each telescope.

Implementation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make
     use of the I-kernel must `load' the kernel, normally during program
     initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their
     names in a data structure called the `kernel pool'. The SPICELIB
     routine LDPOOL loads a kernel file into the pool as shown below.
 
                  CALL LDPOOL ( 'GLL28001.TI' )
 
     In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool,
     the SPICELIB routine RTPOOL is used. See [2] for more details.
 
 
Naming Conventions
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     All names referencing values in this I kernel start with the
     characters `INS' followed by the NAIF HIC instrument number ('-77'
     followed by the instrument subsystem reference number). This naming
     scheme is standard for all I-kernel files and was instituted to
     distinguish I-kernel data from other types of data that may also be
     loaded in the kernel pool.
 
     The remainder of the name is an underscore character, followed by the
     unique name of the data item. For example, the maximum acceptance
     angle for the LET B telescope is specified by
 
                INS-77028_MAX_ACCEP_ANG_B
 
     The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
     characters.
 
     If the same item is included in more then one file, or if the same
     item appears more than once within a single file, the latest value
     supersedes any earlier values.
 
 
DATA
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
        Both of the telescopes are single ended.  The boresight vectors
        for the two telescopes are given with respect to the spacecraft
        rotor Xr, Yr, and Zr axes.
 
        \begindata
 
        INS-77028_LET_B_BORESIGHT = ( 0.68, 0.68, -0.26 )
        INS-77028_LET_E_BORESIGHT = ( 0.68, 0.68, -0.26 )
 
        \begintext
 
        The LET B telescope contains 4 detectors:  LB1, LB2, LB3, and LB4.
        The geometry of LB2 and LB3 limit the maximum acceptance angle to
        25 degrees off axis.
 
        \begindata
 
        INS-77028_LET_B_ACCEP_ANG =  ( 25.0 )
 
        \begintext
 
        The LET E telescope contains five detectors:  LE1, LE2, LE3, LE4,
        and LE 5.  The LE1 and LE2 detectors define a 50 degree viewing
        cone (maximum acceptance angle of 25 degrees off axis) while the
        LE2 and LE5 define a 92 degrees viewing cone (maximum acceptance
        angle of 46 degrees off axis).
 
        \begindata
 
        INS-77028_LET_E_ACCEP_ANG =  ( 25.0, 46.0 )
 
        \begintext
 
        Date on which the above data was entered into this I-kernel.
 
        \begindata
 
        INS-77028_DATA_ENTRY_DATE =  ( @19-OCT-1990 )
 
        \begintext
 
        Version
 
        The version number is always positive and given in the form V.X.
        V and X are incremented by following these rules:
 
          --  V is incremented by 1 when there is a structural change to an
              I-kernel.  A structural change to an instrument kernel would
              be adding or deleting data items or changing the number of
              values associated with an existing data item.  A structural
              change would also be assigning different units to values or
              changing the name of a data item.
 
          --  X is incremented by 1 only if pre-existing values are
              changed.
 
        \begindata
 
        INS-77028_VERSION         = ( 1.0 )
