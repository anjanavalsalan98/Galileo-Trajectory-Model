EPD I-KERNEL
===========================================================================
 
     This I-kernel contains instrument pointing data for the energetic
     particle detector (EPD) on board the Galileo Orbiter. The EPD
     instrument consists of a solid state detector telescope (LEMMS) and a
     foil type detector telescope (CMS). Both telescopes are mounted on a
     rotating platform which, in turn, is mounted on an electronics
     package. The LEMMS telescope has a 45 deg x 15 deg conical field of
     view emanating from opposite ends and the CMS telescope has a 27 deg x
     45 deg conical field of view emanating from opposite ends. The
     platform rotates in cone in eight discrete steps. (These steps are
     refered to as sectors.)

Implementation Notes
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     This file is used by the SPICE system as follows: programs that make
     use of the I-kernel must `load' the kernel, normally during program
     initialization. Loading the kernel associates data items with their
     names in a data structure called the `kernel pool'. The SPICELIB
     routine LDPOOL loads a kernel file into the pool as shown below.
 
                  CALL LDPOOL ( 'GLL25001.TI' )
 
     In order for a program or subroutine to extract data from the pool,
     the SPICELIB routine RTPOOL is used. See [2] for more details.
 
 
Naming Conventions
--------------------------------------------------------
 
     All names referencing values in this I kernel start with the
     characters `INS' followed by the NAIF EPD instrument number ('-77'
     followed by the instrument subsystem reference number). This naming
     scheme is standard for all I-kernel files and was instituted to
     distinguish I-kernel data from other types of data that may also be
     loaded in the kernel pool.
 
     The remainder of the name is an underscore character, followed by the
     unique name of the data item. For example, the maximum acceptance
     angle for the Ja detector is specified by
 
                INS-77025_JA_MAX_ACCEP_ANGLE
 
     The upper bound on the length of the name of any data item is 32
     characters.
 
     If the same item is included in more then one file, or if the same
     item appears more than once within a single file, the latest value
     supersedes any earlier values.
 
 
DATA
--------------------------------------------------------
 
 
        The CMS has five detectors:
 
             1 - Ja
             2 - Ka
             3 - Jb
             4 - Kb
             5 - Kt
 
        The LEMMS has eight detectors:
 
             1 - A
             2 - B
             3 - C
             4 - D
             5 - E1
             6 - E2
             7 - F1
             8 - F2
 
        To find the direction of one of the above detectors at a known
        sector one of two alignment tables (TABLE_1 and TABLE_2) is
        used.   The direction is returned from an alignment table in the
        form of a vector expressed relative to the spacecraft Xr, Yr,
        and Zr axes.
 
        On the CMS, the Ja & Ka and Jb & Kb detectors use TABLE_2 for
        alignment and the Kt detector uses TABLE_1 for alignment.  On the
        LEMMS all but the C & D detectors use TABLE_1 for alignment.  The
        data item INS-77025_DETECTOR_ALIGNMENT contains this information.
        If we let D be an array of the detectors listed in alphabetical
        order, then the I'th element in INS-77025_DETECTOR_ALIGNMENT
        tells us which alignment table should be used for the D(I)
        detector.  See the table below.
