Galileo Spacecraft Trajectory SPK file, Robert Jacobson's 2021 Solution
===========================================================================

     Created by Marc Costa Sitja, NAIF/JPL, February 9, 2022.


Objects in the Ephemeris
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file contains trajectory data for the Galileo spacecraft
     (NAIF ID -77) with respect to the Jupiter Barycenter (5) in the
     J2000 inertial reference frame.

     It also contains ephemerides of the Sun (10), planetary
     barycenters (1-9), Mercury (199), Venus (299), Earth (399), Moon
     (301), Mars (499), and Jupiter (599) and of a few Jovian
     satellites -- Io (501), Europa (502), Ganymede (503), Callisto
     (504), Amalthea (505), and Thebe (514).

     The planetary ephemerides included in this SPK are version DE440;
     the satellite ephemerides included in this file are versions
     JUP365 and MAR097.


Approximate Time Coverage
--------------------------------------------------------

     The Galileo trajectory stored in this SPK file provides
     continuous coverage for the complete mission, specifically:

        Start of Interval (ET)              End of Interval (ET)
        -----------------------------       -----------------------------
        1995 NOV 21 00:00:00.000            2002 NOV 26 08:00:00.000


Status
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file contains reconstructed Galileo trajectory determined by
     Robert A. Jacobson, Solar System Dynamics group, in 2021. It is
     intended for use in support of the Galileo experiment data
     processing and for archiving with the Planetary Data System (PDS).


Pedigree
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file was created by Marc Costa Sitja using the trajectory
     solution provided in the form of a single SPK file by Robert A. Jacobson
     in January 2021. The SPK was provided along with a document internal to
     to JPL:

        R. A. Jacobson, ``The Reconstruction of the Galileo Tour''
        Interoffice Memorandum 392R-21-002, 11 January 2021

     This single SPK file was originated from a number of SPK files merged
     together using the SPKMERGE program by Robert A. Jacobson. The SPKMERGE
     log is provided in the Appendix 1 of these comments.

     The SPK file was merged then together by Marc Costa Sitja with DE440
     planetary ephemerides and JUP365 and MAR097 satellite ephemerides using
     the SPKMERGE program. The SPKMERGE log is provided in the Appendix 2 of
     these comments.


Segment Boundary Discontinuities
--------------------------------------------------------

     The original SPK file contains a large number of Galileo trajectory SPK
     segments that came from original individual SPK files. Although,
     each segment provides continuous trajectory within the interval
     that it covers, in general a position and velocity discontinuity
     exists at the boundary of the segment and the segments whose
     coverage immediately precede and follow it. The times and
     magnitudes of these discontinuities are provided in the Appendix 3
     of these comments.

Appendix 3: Segment Boundary Discontinuity Summary
--------------------------------------------------------

     This SPK file contains a large number of Galileo trajectory SPK
     segments that came from original individual SPK files. Although,
     each segment provides continuous trajectory within the interval
     that it covers, in general a position and velocity discontinuity
     exists at the boundary of the segment and the segments whose
     coverage immediately precede and follow it. The times and
     magnitudes of these discontinuities are provided in the table
     included in this Appendix.

     The top portion of the table contains the name of this SPK file.
     All descriptive lines in the top portion of the file start with
     the ``#'' character to allow direct plotting of the data in the
     freeware ``gnuplot'' application.

     The table consists of 4 columns. The first column contains the UTC
     time of that segment boundary. The last three columns (2..4)
     contain view coordinate frame components -- ``down track'' (this
     direction is parallel to the velocity vector), ``normal to plane''
     (this direction is computed as cross product of position vector by
     velocity vector) and ``in plane'' (this direction is computed as a
     cross product of ``down track'' by ``normal to plane'') -- of the
     difference between the state vectors computed at that UTC time
     defining segment boundary at which a discontinuity exists.

     The pairs of segments and discontinuity times are determined using
     an algorithm that emulates the standard SPK loading priority --
     ``last loaded segment takes precedence''. Therefore, the
     discontinuities summarized in the file are those which a user
     reading file would actually see.

     The difference components in the view coordinate frame were
     computed for each discontinuity using the following algorithm:

         --   A single state was computed from each pair of segment the
              J2000 frame at the time of discontinuity.

         --   For this pair of states, a position difference vector was
              computed by subtracting the state computed from the
              segment with higher priority from the state computed from
              segment with lower priority. Then, a frame transformation
              matrix rotating these difference vectors from J2000 to
              the view coordinate frame defined by the state obtained
              from the higher priority segment was computed, and the
              position difference vector was rotated to the view frame
              coordinates using this matrix.

     The Galileo trajectory segment boundary discontinuities for this
     file are:
