Galileo Spacecraft Trajectory SPK file, Robert Jacobson's 2007 Solution
===========================================================================

     Created by Boris Semenov, NAIF/JPL, September 8, 2011.


Objects in the Ephemeris
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file contains trajectory data for the Galileo spacecraft
     (NAIF ID -77) with respect to the Jupiter Barycenter (5) in the
     J2000 inertial reference frame.

     It also contains ephemerides of the Sun (10), planetary
     barycenters (1-9), Mercury (199), Venus (299), Earth (399), Moon
     (301), Mars (499), and Jupiter (599) and of a few Jovian
     satellites -- Io (501), Europa (502), Ganymede (503), Callisto
     (504), Amalthea (505), and Thebe (514).

     The planetary ephemerides included in this SPK are version DE405;
     the satellite ephemerides included in this file are version
     JUP230.


Approximate Time Coverage
--------------------------------------------------------

     The Galileo trajectory stored in this SPK file provides nearly
     continuous coverage for the primary mission (1995-JUL-01 ...
     1998-JAN-01) and partial coverage with many large gaps for
     extended missions (1998-JAN-01...2003-SEP-22), specifically:

     The planetary and satellite ephemerides provided in this SPK file
     covers the following continuous time interval:

Status
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file contains reconstructed Galileo trajectory determined by
     Robert A. Jacobson, Solar System Dynamics group, in 2007. It is
     intended for use in support of the Galileo experiment data
     processing and for archiving with the Planetary Data System (PDS).


Pedigree
--------------------------------------------------------

     This file was created by Boris Semenov using individual trajectory
     arc solutions for the primary and extended mission trajectory arcs
     provided in the form of NIO files by Robert A. Jacobson in 2007.
     These NIO files were converted to SPK format using the NIOSPK
     program and then merged together with DE405/LE405 planetary
     ephemerides and JUP230 satellite ephemerides using the SPKMERGE
     program. The SPKMERGE log is provided in the Appendix 1 of these
     comments.


Segment Boundary Discontinuities
--------------------------------------------------------

     This SPK file contains a large number of Galileo trajectory SPK
     segments that came from original individual SPK files. Although,
     each segment provides continuous trajectory within the interval
     that it covers, in general a position and velocity discontinuity
     exists at the boundary of the segment and the segments whose
     coverage immediately precede and follow it. The times and
     magnitudes of these discontinuities are provided in the Appendix 2
     of these comments.

Appendix 2: Segment Boundary Discontinuity Summary
--------------------------------------------------------

     This SPK file contains a large number of Galileo trajectory SPK
     segments that came from original individual SPK files. Although,
     each segment provides continuous trajectory within the interval
     that it covers, in general a position and velocity discontinuity
     exists at the boundary of the segment and the segments whose
     coverage immediately precede and follow it. The times and
     magnitudes of these discontinuities are provided in the table
     included in this Appendix.

     The top portion of the table contains the name of this SPK file.
     All descriptive lines in the top portion of the file start with
     the ``#'' character to allow direct plotting of the data in the
     freeware ``gnuplot'' application.

     The table consists of 4 columns. The first column contains the UTC
     time of that segment boundary. The last three columns (2..4)
     contain view coordinate frame components -- ``down track'' (this
     direction is parallel to the velocity vector), ``normal to plane''
     (this direction is computed as cross product of position vector by
     velocity vector) and ``in plane'' (this direction is computed as a
     cross product of ``down track'' by ``normal to plane'') -- of the
     difference between the state vectors computed at that UTC time
     defining segment boundary at which a discontinuity exists.

     The pairs of segments and discontinuity times are determined using
     an algorithm that emulates the standard SPK loading priority --
     ``last loaded segment takes precedence''. Therefore, the
     discontinuities summarized in the file are those which a user
     reading file would actually see.

     The difference components in the view coordinate frame were
     computed for each discontinuity using the following algorithm:

         --   A single state was computed from each pair of segment the
              J2000 frame at the time of discontinuity.

         --   For this pair of states, a position difference vector was
              computed by subtracting the state computed from the
              segment with higher priority from the state computed from
              segment with lower priority. Then, a frame transformation
              matrix rotating these difference vectors from J2000 to
              the view coordinate frame defined by the state obtained
              from the higher priority segment was computed, and the
              position difference vector was rotated to the view frame
              coordinates using this matrix.

     The Galileo trajectory segment boundary discontinuities for this
     file are:
